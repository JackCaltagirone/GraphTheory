G00349976 graph theory Project


When we got the problem i thought about it for a while. didnt understand how i would go about it.
After watching the videos provided, it gave insight on how i should go about it.

I decided to break the project into 4 mains steps.

Steps:
Step 1: Take in the user input of an expression, and a string
Step 2: shunt the input from infix to postfix
Step 3: turn the postfix input into a NFA
Step 4: Compare the newly created NFA to the user entered String

Details:
Step 1: Wishing the other steps were as easy as this one. It was a simple two lines.
the the lines are located @ lines 12 and 13. simple takes input and assings them to two variables 
approately named

Step 2: I now take the user entered expression and parse it through the shunting yard algoritim. 
Parsing it through the algoritim will change the user inputed infix notation expression to a postfix notation expression.
